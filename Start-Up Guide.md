This Repository covers Dsa problems and Their Algorithms, Way of thinking to them + patterns + Topic wise.


# 🚀 DSA Pattern-Based Learning Journey

📅 Starting Date: 1st April

Welcome to my DSA Pattern-Based Learning repository! 🎯 This is where I'll be solving problems topic-wise and, more importantly, pattern-wise to help recognize hidden structures in problems efficiently.

🔥 What to Expect?

🧩 Pattern Recognition – Understanding how to identify patterns in problems.

🏗 Structured Topic-Wise Approach – Beginning with arrays, then diving deep into various patterns.

🏆 Multiple Approaches – Solving problems using brute force → better → best approaches.

📌 Well-Organized Solutions – Categorized by pattern and problem type.

🤝 Follow Along – You can join me by practicing the same problems and improving together!

🎯 Why Focus on Patterns Instead of Just Topics?

Most coding interviews don’t just ask direct questions on topics; instead, they revolve around patterns. Recognizing patterns helps in:

✅ Quickly identifying optimal solutions to unseen problems.✅ Mastering variations of common problem types.✅ Building strong problem-solving intuition for interviews.

Thus, instead of just going topic-wise, we will master each pattern in-depth! 🏆

🔍 My Approach

# Each pattern will have:

🏗 Detailed Explanation of the pattern.

🛠 Varieties within the pattern (e.g., Two Pointers: adjacent, opposite side, fast-slow, situation-based).

💡 Each Practice Problem categorized by brute force solution → optimized solutions.

⏳ Focus on Time & Space Complexity improvements.
