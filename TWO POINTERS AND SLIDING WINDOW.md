# 🔄 Two Pointers & Sliding Window: How They're Interrelated
Both patterns are often used together in problems involving arrays and strings. While two pointers generally refer to using two variables to traverse or compare elements, sliding window applies this idea in a more structured way—especially useful for subarray/substring problems.
🧠 Once you understand the two pointers technique, you’ll see how sliding window is simply a specialized use-case where the pointers move with specific window rules (size-fixed or condition-based).

# there are only four types of problems that you will see in this topic from all over leetcode.
1️⃣ Constant Window Size
Useful for problems where the window size is fixed.
📘 Example: Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards(https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/)

2️⃣ Maximum Subarray / Substring Type Questions
Dynamic window size that grows or shrinks based on a condition.
📘 Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters(https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

3️⃣ Number of Subarrays That Meet a Condition
Count how many subarrays satisfy a given condition (sum, product, etc.)
📘 Example: Subarrays with Product Less than K(https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/description/)

4️⃣ Minimum Substring That Meets a Condition
Shrink window until it just satisfies the condition (commonly used in string problems).
📘 Example: Minimum Window Substring(https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)
